# PLPproj2

Our project is able to handle basic IO, constructors, destructors, objects, encapsulation, functions, procedures, for loops, while loops, break and continue.

To compile the code run the following command.

`javac -cp .:./antlr_files:[PATH TO ANTLR JAR]  --enable-preview --source 23 Interpreter.java
` 

To run the code, use the following command:

`java -cp .:./antlr_files:[PATH TO ANTLR JAR]  --enable-preview Interpreter`

Running Interpreter will run all of our test files and print out the expected output too. In the test_files dir we have each of the pascal src code files and a .out file corresponding to the expected output.
